# FastAPI on Azure with Docker & CI/CD

## Overview
This project demonstrates deploying a **FastAPI** web application to **Azure App Service** using:
- **Docker** for containerisation  
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation  
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** for image storage

The goal was to show how application deployments can be made **automated**, **repeatable**, and **reliable**, rather than manual pushes.

## Real-World Relevance
This project reflects typical DevOps workflows:
- **Containerisation:** consistent app packaging across environments  
- **CI/CD Automation:** reliable builds & deployments on every commit  
- **Cloud Deployment:** scalable web app hosted in Azure App Service  
- **Health Checks:** smoke test ensures the app runs after deployment  

---

## Features
- REST API with FastAPI  
- Dockerized for portability  
- Automated build & push to Azure Container Registry  
- Deployment to Azure App Service  
- Smoke test verifies health after deployment  

---

## Deployment Pipeline
GitHub Actions runs on every push to `main`:
1. **Checkout** → Pull code  
2. **Azure Login** → Authenticate with Service Principal (Azure)  
3. **Build Docker Image** → Package FastAPI app  
4. **Push Image** → Upload to ACR  
5. **Deploy** → Deploy container to Azure App Service  
6. **Smoke Test** → Verify `/health` endpoint  

---

## Endpoints
- `GET /` → Welcome message  
- `GET /health` → Returns app health status  

Example response for `/`:
```json
{
  "message": "Hello from FastAPI in Docker with CI/CD"
}
```

Example response for `/health`:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```
